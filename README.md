I developed a complete Hospital Management System using Java and JDBC. 

Here's what I learned from this project:

1. 🔧 Setting up the Development Environment: I began by configuring my Java development environment and ensuring that I had all the necessary tools and libraries.

2. 📊 Creating a Database Schema: I learned how to design a database schema tailored for the Hospital Management System using MySQL or another preferred database system. This involved creating tables for patients, doctors, appointments, and more, while establishing essential relationships and constraints.

3. ☕ Java JDBC Connectivity: I demonstrated how to establish a seamless connection between Java and the database using JDBC, which is a fundamental skill for any database-driven application.

4. 🏥 Managing Patients and Doctors: I gained experience in adding, viewing, and managing patient and doctor information within the system.

5. 📅 Booking Appointments: I implemented functionality to schedule appointments, ensuring a smooth healthcare scheduling process.

6. 🙋‍♂️ Checking Doctor Availability: I created a feature that allows users to check doctor availability for specific dates. How to add, view, and manage patient and doctor information within the system.
